# FeedCraft

FeedCraft is an iOS app that allows you to craft the perfect feed on your GitHub hosted blog.

It is created and maintiained by [Jay Wilson](https://jaywilson.zip/), who wants an easier to post to his blog.

## Are there plans to open the app?

Yes! Jay does plan to open the app's source code once the app is ready for v1.0, but for right now it's closed so that he can code like a slob to get v1.0 shipped.

If you're interested in the status, the [issue tracker](https://github.com/feedcraftxyz/FeedCraft/issues) is open though.

## Important notes about the app

- It will be a paid subscription to actually use the GitHub integration and some other features
- If you don't pay, you can still copy your content to get it out of the app

## Feedback!

All feedback is accepted and will be considered no matter how you send it.

Preferrably make a [disscussion](https://github.com/feedcraftxyz/FeedCraft/discussions) on this repo, and it will be addressed.
